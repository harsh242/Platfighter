# Platfighter
## Abstract
We are making a 2-D, online multiplayer game. Our creative vision is to have a game that borrows elements from the 2D platformer genre and the 2D fighter genre, and blend those to create a unique and fun experience. Broadly speaking, we envision 2D arenas or levels where a group of friends will fight it out among themselves, and the combat will take the form similar to that of classic fighting games. 

A priority for us is that the game should be accessible - i.e., it should have minimal system requirements, take little to no storage, and bandwidth requirements should be low. A group of friends should be able to quickly and easily pick it up with minimal hassle, and should not need to prepare in advance. 

Thus, we have decided that the game should run in the web browser, and be developed with web technologies that are supported by all modern web browsers. So, the tools of choice are going to be HTML5, and JavaScript and its frameworks.
